            		<p class="blog-post-meta">October 17, 2018</p>

					<p>
						The first release of IQuOD database has been completed. IQuODv0.1 is publicly available, and contains uncertainty values for temperature and salinity (where possible), as well as intelligent metadata for XBT probe types (see: <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0129.1" target="_blank">https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0129.1</a>). For v0.1, quality flags on the data are WOD-based flags and originators flags where available.

            		<h3>The ‘International Quality Controlled Ocean Dataset Validation Suite’ project has begun.  </h3>
            		<p class="blog-post-meta">August, 2014</p>
					<p>
						The code is open-sourced and you can participate here: <a href="https://github.com/IQuOD" target="_blank">https://github.com/IQuOD</a>
						<br>Here is the project brief:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Recent studies suggest that changes to global climate as have been seen at the Earth's land and ocean surface are also making their way into the deep ocean, which is the largest active storage system for heat and carbon available on the timescale of a human lifetime. Historical measurements of subsurface ocean temperature are essential to the scientific research investigating the changes in the amount of heat stored in the ocean and also to other climate research activities such as combining observations with numerical models to provide estimates of the global ocean's and Earth's climate state in the past and predictions for the future. Unfortunately, as with all observations, these measurements contain errors and biases that must be identified to prevent a negative impact on the applications and investigations that rely on them. Various groups from around the world have developed quality control tests to perform this important task. However, this has led to duplication of effort, code that is not easily available to other researchers and the introduction of climate model differences solely due to the varying performance of these software systems whose nuances relative to one another are poorly known. Recently, an international team of researchers has decided to work together to break down the barriers between the various groups and countries through the formation of the IQuOD (International Quality Controlled Dataset) initiative. One of the key aims is to intercompare the performance of the various automatic quality control tests that are presently being run to determine a best performing set. This work has started. However, it currently involves individuals running test datasets through their own systems and is being confounded by complications associated with the differences in the file formats and systems that are in use in the various labs and countries. The IQuOD proposal is to set up an open quality control benchmarking system. Work will begin by developing an open-source Python testing framework to run a battery of checks developed by the researchers over a body of user-supplied data; this framework should be built with ease of extension to further tests in mind.  Further goals include helping researchers either wrap their existing C, Fortran and Matlab test functions in Python for use in this test suite, or re-implementing those tests in native Python.</p>

            		<h3>2nd IQuOD Workshop held in Silver Spring, MD </h3>
            		<p class="blog-post-meta">July, 2014</p>
					<p>The workshop was hosted by NOAA in Silver Spring, MD, USA. A common theme in several presentations and subsequent discussions was the value of providing a standardised data-set that quantifies known biases for particular instrument types and provides measurement uncertainties. It was noted such data would be invaluable for use in research focused on model and observation intercomparisons and initialization for ocean reanalysis products. Temperature will be the initial focus for IQuOD, moving to salinity and other variables as the project develops. An initial priority list of instrument types was constructed based on the number and importance of these instruments in the global database and the groups’ expertise. It is expected the list will be revised as the project develops. The technical aspects of developing the QC methods, assigning QC flags and uncertainties were reviewed, with a goal to refine, finalise and report on automatic QC benchmarking tests in 2015. The <b>2nd IQuOD workshop report</b> is now available <a href="">here</a> and summarises the presentations and discussions held over the 3 days.</p>
